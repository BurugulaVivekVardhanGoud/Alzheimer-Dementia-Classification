# Alzheimer's Disease Classification Model

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust classification model for Alzheimer's disease, categorizing it into four classes: Mild Demented, Very Mild Demented, Non-Demented, and Unknown Demented. The model, utilizing a cutting-edge neural network architecture, has achieved an impressive test accuracy of 99.12%.

## Classes

1. **Mild Demented:** Represents cases with mild dementia.
2. **Very Mild Demented:** Denotes instances of very mild dementia.
3. **Non-Demented:** Indicates individuals without dementia.
4. **Unknown Demented:** A category for cases where dementia status is unknown.

## Model Details

The neural network is specifically designed for the task of Alzheimer's disease image classification. Trained on an extensive and diverse dataset, the model demonstrates exceptional performance with a test accuracy of 99.12%. This underscores its efficacy in accurately identifying different stages of Alzheimer's disease.

### Key Features
